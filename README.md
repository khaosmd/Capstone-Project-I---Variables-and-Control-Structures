# Capstone-Project-I---Variables-and-Control-Structures

Compulsory Task 1 (InvestmentCalculator.py):

This program is an investment calculator and calculates the future value of an investment.

The user inputs the initial deposit amount, the interest rate, the number of years invested, and if the interest should be simple or compound. These values are stored as variables, which are then used to calculate the future value, which is printed to the screen.

Compulsory Task 2 (Lottery.py):

This program lets the user play the lottery. It compares a random number to one entered by the user and determines if the user won anything.

The program generates a random two-digit number between 10 and 99. This number is the lottery number. The user is asked to guess the number by entering a two-digit number. The lottery number is printed to screen and a message is printed to the screen if the user's guess matches the lottery number. A different message is printed if the user's number matches the lottery number but the digits are in the wrong order. Another different message is printed if the user guesses one digit correctly. And lastly, another, different message is printed to the screen if the user's number doesn't match the lottery number.
